# Recipe Complexity Optimizer

Recipe Complexity Optimizer is a free tool that uses the Edamam API to search for recipes, and then sorts them based on relative complexity!

The complexity of each recipe is calculated based on an algorithm that takes into acount dish type, preparation time, and cooking time.

Currently running on the free version of the Edamam API, so rate usage is limited. Please contact me for a demonstration!
